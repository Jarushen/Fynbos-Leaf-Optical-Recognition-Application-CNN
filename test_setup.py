Test Setup for Fynbos Leaf Optical Recognition

This script demonstrates a full workflow:
1. Train a model using a dataset from Google Drive
2. Input a new image for prediction
3. Return classification label, probability, and SHAP plots
"""

# 1. Google Drive Integration
# (If running in Colab, use the following)
# from google.colab import drive
# drive.mount('/content/drive')

# 2. Training
from src.train import main as train_main
# You may need to adjust train_main to accept parameters for dataset path

# 3. Prediction
from src.test_image import load_image, main as test_main
# You may need to refactor test_main to accept image path as argument

# 4. SHAP Analysis
from src.shap_analysis import compute_shap_values, shap_overlay

# Example usage (pseudo-code):
# train_main(dataset_path='path/to/drive/dataset')
# img = load_image('path/to/new/image.jpg')
# label, prob = predict(img)
# shap_values = compute_shap_values(model, img)
# shap_overlay(img, shap_values)

# TODO: Implement argument parsing and function calls for a seamless workflow.

print("Test setup script template created. Please complete integration as needed.")
